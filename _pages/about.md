I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **University of Amsterdam** in the [VisLab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/) group, where I work on the intersection of **robot learning** and **computer vision**. My research aims to make robots more capable of understanding and adapting to the complex, dynamic environments in which humans live and work. I am particularly interested in topics such as **real2sim2real** transfer, **few-shot learning**, **3D vision**, and **human perception**, with the overarching goal of developing learning systems that allow robots to acquire new skills efficiently and interact naturally with people. My ultimate goal is to enable robots to better understand and assist humans in real-world environments.

Before joining the University of Amsterdam, I completed my Ph.D. in **Artificial Intelligence (cum laude)** through a joint program between Politecnico di Torino and the University of Padova, where I worked within the **Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory (IASLab)**.
